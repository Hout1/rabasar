The noise model $P(I | I_0)$ is the fully-developed speckle model (see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05335) and references therein). This tool is then applied to:\n",

    "+  the ratio of each intensity image with the reference image (using a slightly different noise model than the fully developed speckle model).\n",

    "The final de-sepeckled image is then the (denoised ratio) $\\times$ (the denoised reference image). Each denoising step is solved using the [Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/admm_distr_stats.html) (ADMM).\n",
